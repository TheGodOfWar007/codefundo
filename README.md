ICPO (INDIAN CYCLONE PREDICTING ORGANIZATION)

proposed name: icpo.com

THE IDEA:
We are planning to build a website which is going to predict and prevent the economic losses due to any natural disaster.

THE WORKING:
The main focus will be on preventing economic loss and hence the main focus will be on to predicting the natural disaster. "Our main focus will be on INDIAN COASTAL AREAS" and to prevent lives by developing an algorithm which when given the appropriate inputs may predict cyclones and tsunamis to an extent enough for the user to atleast keep an eye and be aware of the weather conditions near his home,office,etc whatever be near the coast. It will actually require some thorough knowledge as to which pressure conditions will envoke a cyclone, which wind directions and currents trigger the formation of a wind vortex which ultimately turns into a cyclone.

OUR MAIN OBJECTIVE:
To make the user aware and atleast alert about the changes in wheather which may turn into a disaster so that he may make appropriate preparations given the time.

THE ROLE OF THE USER:
The user will actually first need to sign into our website and enable push notifications. Then the website will require the user to enter the name of the coastal city the user lives in and the name of ocean or sea which forms its coast. Then the user will need to tell us about any of the past occurences of such natural calamities and their specific time periods if possible. In short we may try to collect as much data as possible so as to make prediction strong enough. Once the role of the user is completed the the another intrinsic algorithm may try to retrieve the relevant weather information from relevant sources (which are yet to be decided, most probably will be 'INDIAN METROLOGICAL SERVICES').

DATASETS USED:
As mentioned above, some data will be entered by the user, and rest of the data for eg: the speed of winds, relative humidity, temperature, pressure, wind currents, the latitude and longitude, etc. (If needed we may use 'fractals' to predict the calamity), coastal topography.

TECHNOLOGY TO BE USED:
Most probably fractals, python algorithms, some PHP algorithms, MySQL to handle the data, defenately some data given by the sattelites, radars, etc if possible. We may try to gain access to the data of the INDIAN METEROLOGICAL DEPARTMENT.
